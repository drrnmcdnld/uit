# Idea

Before you can work on getting your startup off the ground, you need to have an idea. If you don't have any ideas, you need some inspiration. If you have many ideas, you need some validation. This section is focused on idea creation and validation.

## 99 Problems

In a group, create a list of 99 problems. These problems should be personal to you, as in you're personally experienced the problem. The more you've experienced the problem the better. Think of things that are annoying, painful, too slow, too expensive, too large, too confusing, too complicated, ugly, antiquated, unavailable, frustrating, etc, etc. Write them down. You don't need to have a viable solution in mind at this point. Just brain dump a whole bunch of problems.

## 9 Solutions

As a group, pick 9 of the above problems and think of some solutions. How could the problem be solved? Can you solve it with software? With hardware? With a new business model? With better design? With different meterials? With simpler pricing?

## Validation

Pick your favorite solution to a problem and write it down. If you write down the same solution as someone else, you can work on this step as a team.

### People

Write down the type of people you think would have the same problem. Next, write down 3 questions you could ask those people, to validate your assumption. How can you contact them? Can you email them, call them on the phone, create a landing page, setup a crowdfunding campaign, post to [reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/7zlyd/my_gift_to_reddit_i_created_an_image_hosting/) or Facebook, speak with them in person? Figure it out. Hearing their opinion will help validate your idea.

### Competition

Are there any competitors out there? Google it. If there are no competitors, is that a good sign, or a bad sign? Why do you think there are no companies actively trying to solve this problem? Are there no viable solutions? Is there no business model? Are there no customers?

If there are competitors, analyze their solution. Are they doing anything wrong? What are they doing right? Have they created a barrier to entry that will make it difficult for you to compete? Could you have any advantage over them?
