##Social Network Database

For this segment of the social network project you will implement a database for user profiles, relationships between users, and any other feature required in your MVP. You should be able to register users, login, and save profile information to the database.

1. Introduction to Databases: Checkout the [Database](../../technology/database) section for an introduction to relational data and SQL. Complete Stanford's mini-course on [Introduction to Databases](https://class.stanford.edu/courses/DB/2014/SelfPaced/about) to learn about relational data and SQL.

2. Blog Post: Once you've comfortable with the concept of relational data, **write a short blog post explaining relational databases to an absolute beginner**.

3. Data Design: Next, you'll design the data for your social network. Write down the table and column names that you'll need. You can represent the data on paper similar to a spreadsheet. Make sure you have a clean idea in your head and on paper before setting up an actual database. This is similar to the wireframing stage when designing your interface, as it helps you map things out.

4. Setting up your Database: You're going to use Postgres. Checkout the [Postgres](../../technology/database/postgresql.md) section for help installing Postgres locally and connecting from Node.js.
