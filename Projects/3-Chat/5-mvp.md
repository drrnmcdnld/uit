##Chat MVP

For this week you will finish your chat application features, host it on digital ocean, and live demo your chat. Most of you elaborated on the chat features you wished to implement when Permjot visited, if you didn't pitch a feature for your chat, develop something that sets your chat apart from the others.

We will have Goinstant developer, Jeff Anderson, do a presentation and question period on Wednesday over Skype.
You should have a good idea of the questions you would like to ask him.

Lastly, be vocal on slack, reach out to the team (or anyone!) for feedback on your MVP. Find a common pain point and come up with a solution. If you think it is a problem, make sure others agree with you!

This is the last week for the chat application, you will have to live demo a functioning product this friday!

Have a great week!

You've already installed Redis, but now you need to run Redis as a service on your Ubuntu server. See the section called "Installing Redis more properly" in the [Redis Quick Start](http://redis.io/topics/quickstart). This will show you use a system in Ubuntu called `upstart`, which is used to run programs as services. You can read more about upstart in the [UbuntuBootupHowto](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBootupHowto).
