#Contributing Guidelines

- Simplest way is to create a [New Issue](https://github.com/uit/uit/issues/new) and put the link to the content there with a short desciption of why it's useful and we'll do the rest.
- [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) this repo and after adding new links to it, make a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).
- You can send us an email with the subject of [UIT Content](mailto:contact@uitstartup.org?subject=UIT%20Content:).


## Folders

 - Link each subject to a file

## Files
Each file should have a simple name

1. Describe the subject
