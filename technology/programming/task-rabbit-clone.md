##Task Rabbit Clone

- Go to [Code4Startup.com](https://code4startup.com/) & create an account (sign in with GitHub)

- Go to projects and select Project Ninja

- Watch what you are going to build in this project.

- Follow the Setup Video. I recommend following along with [Sublime Text](http://c758482.r82.cf2.rackcdn.com/Sublime%20Text%20Build%203083.dmg)...Webstorm is adding files and possibly confusing things.

- Create a new GitHub repo and only copy the contents of the TaskNinja-Seed Folder, you can keep the other folders around for review but only build off of the files in this folder.

- Follow the Guides and **TAKE YOUR TIME**, be sure to pay attention to syntax. A lot of errors and broken code will come from this.

- After each segment of coding you complete commit to GitHub.

BONUS : Create a github.pages for your application to share progress with the group.

Double BONUS : Alter the idea to make it your own.
