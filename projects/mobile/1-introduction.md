##Mobile Development with Cordova

We will be learning to develop a mobile application using cordova. Apache Cordova is a set of device APIs that allow a mobile app developer to access native device functions such as the camera, accelerometer or geo navigator from JavaScript.  This allows a smartphone app to be developed with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and combined with the [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/), will allow you to also achieve a mobile-friendly feel to your apps.

This week your focus will be on creating a login splash page with some functionality on a mobile interface.
