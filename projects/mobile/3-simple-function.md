##Simple Feature Function Mobile Application

You've worked with Cordova/Ionic, and built a rest api. By the end of this week, you should be able to build a functioning mobile application that stores it's data in the backend.

To be clear...the end goal this week is for everyone to present their mobile application this Friday.
This is a mobile application written in cordova/ionic, with an express rest api backend (Jeff's tutorial), and finally using Angular's $http to make requests to the rest api to store/retrieve data.

There will be no blogs this week, but please commit to github often so we see your progress.

- [Angular's $http](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$http)



Please reference all of the topics weâ€™ve covered in the last 2 weeks.
