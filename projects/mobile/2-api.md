##RESTful API

This week will be focused on consuming, modeling and planning an API (Application Programming Interface). You should spend the majority of your time this week on the tutorial [Jeff Andersen](https://twitter.com/jeffandersen) has kindly donated his time to author for UIT based on your feedback of preferred learning methods. Complete his tutorial by Wednesday so you can be prepared for a Q & A Session.

Any spare time should be spent on other coursework... [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/), [CodeSchool](https://www.codeschool.com/) & the recently attained [lynda.com](http://www.lynda.com/) accounts (Thanks again, [Patrick!](https://twitter.com/phankinson)).
