##RESTful API

This week will be focused on consuming, modeling and planning an API (Application Programming Interface). You should spend most of your time this week on course material... codecademy, codeschool & the recently attained lynda.com accounts (Thanks again, [Patrick!](https://twitter.com/phankinson)).

Also, [Jeff Andersen](https://twitter.com/jeffandersen) has kindly donated his time to author a UIT customized, REST API tutorial based on your feedback of preferred learning methods.
