##_Blog_

For this project you will learn how to deploy software to a cloud based server, buy a domain name, configure dns, and ssh into the server. This blog will be updated throughout the year as you complete projects, discover new resources, or if you just want to share your excitement with a recent breakthrough. Ghost will be used as your publishing platform, and DigitalOcean as your Cloud Server.

###_Task List:_

- Install Ghost locally.
- Go to DigitalOcean and create an account.
- Use the promotion code we provide and create an Ubuntu droplet.
- Deploy Ghost on your DigitalOcean droplet.
- Purchase a domain name. Configure your name servers (NS records) to point to Cloudflare DNS.
- Configure your DNS to point your A Records to your DigitalOcean IP Address
- Generate an SSH Key for your new server and connect to the DigitalOcean remote server.
- Log into your blog and write a blog post about what you learned and the overall experience.
- Submit the URL of your first blog post to Rob.
