UIT's mentors are here to create relationships with our student founders, helping them with the hurdles that go with running a startup. UIT focuses on exposing and connecting our startup founders to a growing community of key mentors and advisors that provide expertise from a multitude of subjects. Student founders whoâ€™ve gone through our program tell us that the UIT mentor community is our most valuable asset.
