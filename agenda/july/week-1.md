####Monday, June 29th

This week we will be working on your online portfolios!  In order to stand out in a tough market such as IT and programming, it is important to make your online portfolio as impressive as you can.  As you work through your portfolio, Rob can provide feedback on what you should or should not include, as well as if you are presenting your skills and experience to the most effective degree.

To get a head-start, you can check out some cool portfolio examples here: http://www.creativebloq.com/portfolios/examples-712368
